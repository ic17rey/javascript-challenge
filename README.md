# JavaScript Challenge - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

### Goal  
Take the starter code data in data.js for UFO sightings and display the information in a table in the web browser. Allow for the data to be searched filtering by date. For the second part of the challenge, create additional filters for users to input and search through data.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
The directory **UFO-level-1** includes an index.html file (from the starter code provided for the challenge) and also a directory 'static'. Within static data.js and app.js files are found. Data.js is the file that stores the UFO sighting information. App.js is the script containing the code for displaying the table, for the functionality of the date search, and for displaying the resulting table after a date is entered for the filter. 

The table including all data loads in the browser when opening index.html. Once a user inputs a date and hits enter, or inputs a date and clicks on the Filter Table button, the table updates to only the UFO sightings for that date input by the user.


### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional Part 2 of the Challenge)
The directory **UFO-level-2** includes the same setup of files as UFO-level-1. This index.html is updated to display multiple filters for searching. The setup displayed includes search boxes for the following:

  1. `date`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`  

The code for app.js **UFO-level-2** is incomplete. Some progress is made to allow a user to input a date and a city, and clicking the Filter Table button will display the resulting table of results. An image "Screenshot date&city filter" is included showing the results of a search for 1/1/2010, city el cajon.
